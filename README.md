# TypeScript e-commerce store

## Demo of this app:

![demo](./src/assets/cute-buddy-demo.gif)

### Or Go to the live site and try it for yourself [here](https://cute-buddy.netlify.app/)


## What is this project about?
- An e-commerce app that allows shoppers to view, sort and filter products according to different criteria. After products are added to shopping cart, payment is processed with Stripe API.
- This is a TypeScript, Sanity CMS, GraphQL and Stripe API learning project, I took the skelton of [this Udemy course project](https://react-course-comfy-sloth-store.netlify.app/). The difference between the original one and my version are:
  - replaced the JavaScript code with TypeScript.
  - Instead of using dummy data and API provided by the Udemy course, I use some real product data from a friend's Instagram store. Sanity CMS is used to host the data, GraphQL is used to query the data.

## What technologies were used?

- react.js (create-react-app)
- TypeScript

### Styling:
- styled-components
- CSS
### Routing:
- react-router
### Payment processing:
- Stripe API
### CMS:
- Sanity
- GraphQL
- axios
### Hosting and server side functions
- Netlify

## How to navigate this project? Click on the link for related source code:
1. A simple [Sanity CMS schema](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/cutebuddy/schemas/product.js) is used: add, amend or delete product can be done on the CMS instead of in the source code.

2. Click on each `ServicesCard` button will do two things:
  - route to `ProductsPage`;
  - filter the products according to which button gets clicked on.
  <img src="./src/assets/services-button.png" alt="services-button" width="70%"/>
    - To achieve this, it has to go through three steps:
      1. clear the previous filters
      2. set `isClickFromServices` state variable to tru
      3. update filters according to the button gets clicked on

      [Click here for the relevant code](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/components/Services/ServicesCards.tsx#L21) .
    - Why is there a `isClickFromServices` variable?
      - Each time `ServicesPage` is mounted, the page should display all product, i.e. filters should be cleared.
      - But when routed from `Services` component, `ProductsPage` should display products of relevant service.
      - To work around this, an if statement is used to check if the page is routed from `Services`, [click here for the relevant code](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx#L10). 


3. Shoppers can choose to view the products in `ListView` or `GridView`. [Click here for relevant code](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/components/ProductList.tsx#L24).

4. Shoppers are able to filter products by different criteria, such as by keyword, price, etc. 
  - [Click here for code structure](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/components/Filters/Filters.tsx#L22); 
  - [Click here for filters updating function](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/reducers/filter_reducer.ts#L61).


5. Products can be sorted by price or name, in ascending or descending order [Click here for sorting function](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/reducers/filter_reducer.ts#L41).


6. Payment is processed by Stripe API, [click here for relevant code](https://github.com/1codingguy/typescript-e-commerce/blob/main/src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx).


## Why I built the project this way?
### About filtering:

Lots of thoughts were given about filter functions related to 'age' and 'height' because of the nature of baby product. I am listing some reasons why `age` and `height` filters are setup in this way:

1. create "baskets of categories"

- Baby products in general are labelled as suitable for different ages, for instance: 
  - 3-6 months
  - under 1 year old, or 
  - all ages
- To filter the products according these age descriptions, first I need to create some "baskets" of fixed categories like these:
  - 0-3 months
  - 3-6 months
  - 6-9 months
  - 9-12 months
  - 12-24 months
  - 24 months +
- Then assign a product one or more of these categories. For example, 
  - if a product is suitable for infant of `3-6 months`, then assign only such category.
  - if a product is labelled `0+`, i.e. suitable for all ages, then all of these categories should be assigned to the product.

2. Why use checkbox for `age` filter, instead of selection tab like `category`?
- A product can only be either a piece of `toy` or a piece of `clothing`, but cannot be both. Click on selection tab of `toy`  should display all the `toy`  product.
- But a product can be suitable for multiple age categories, for example: a product for infant under 6 months should have both `0-3 months` and `3-6 months`. Since multiple choices can be selected at the same time, checkbox should be used.
- By default when the page mounts, it displays all products, which implicitly means none of the filters are applied. So a checkbox of `all` is not needed for `age` (unlike `category` filter) because the app should allow the user to apply different criteria one by one, instead of applying all the filters for the user by default.

- <img src="./src/assets/age-checkbox.png" alt="age-checkbox" width="70%"/>

3. There should be text description about `age` and `height` other than the 'category baskets' alone.
- if a product is suitable for an infant of height 65 cm, it is inside the category of `60-69 cm` for filtering purpose. 
- But in the `singleProductPage`, it states "suitable for height: 65cm" to provide some readable text to the user. 
- That means there are two fields related to 'height' factor in the Schema:
  - `height` refers the categories (e.g. '60-69 cm'), a product can have zero or multiple of such categories.
  - `heightDescription` refers to the text description specified from the product manufacturer, which is also a more precise product description in readable text.

### Why using react-router v5 instead of the latest react-router v6?
- When I started the project, the latest react-router v6 was released.
- I chose to keep using react-router v5 instead since this project is mainly a TypeScript learning project. Adapt to the latest version of react-router wasn't my priority.

## What can be further improved?
1. filter in mobile view, should use a modal instead of a toggle-able menu.
<img src="./src/assets/filter-toggle.png" alt="filter-toggle" width="70%">

2. Schema design should take into account that that one product can have different variants. For instance, A product with different colour and sizes. 
    - Different variants of a product should have the same product_id, but a different SKU, which is not implemented in this project.
